I created it in full french first, and after I created a full english version. I try to be clear for an educational purpose, and make lot of comments in the code source.

And you can import the programs :
- English Version "CDL972-0"
- French Version "JBT330-3"

The zip file contains the source code and the compiled program with the Small Basic library.

The french version is here :  https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Jeu-Small-Basic-Apprendre-8f9eb2e6.
